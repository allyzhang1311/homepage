            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently a senior at Cornell University pursuing
                a B.A. in Computer Science and Linguistics. My main areas of
                interest are system architecture, natural language processing
                and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've interned at Fidelity Investments and MasterCard, where
                I spent summers developing websites and tools for internal testers.
                Additionally, I've conducted NLP research in both the Linguistics and
                Computer Science departments, focusing on machine learning and automated
                phonetic transcription. During the school year, I work as a senior TA
                for Computer System Organization and Programming (CS 3410), Cornell's
                core systems and C course.

                In my spare time, I like to sing in the Cornell Chorale, hike around
                Ithaca's beautiful gorges, and doodle aimlessly. I'm also a big
                fan of fantasy novels and am now on my tenth <em>Lord of the Rings</em> read-through.
                Probably more than tenth, actually...
