            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I've been a enterprising coder ever since I was eleven, when I made my own
                review blog on Neopets (to deafening acclaim, of course). In high school I started
                learning CS fundamentals in earnest, got hooked, and never looked back.
                I'm now experienced in <b>Python, Java, SQL, C/C++</b>, and a wide range
                of <b>web frameworks</b> and languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I interned at <b>Fidelity Investments</b> and <b>Mastercard</b>, where
                I spent summers developing web applications, meeting with clients, and
                learning the ins-and-outs of full-stack development in the world of
                financial tech.
                Additionally, I've conducted <b>NLP research</b> in both the Linguistics and
                Computer Science departments, focusing on machine learning and automated
                phonetic transcription. More on that in the projects tab.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the school year, I work as a <b>senior TA</b> for
                Computer System Organization and Programming (CS 3410), Cornell's
                core systems and C course. Can you say "segfault" three times fast?!
                An archived version of the course can be
                found <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I like to sing in the Cornell Chorale, hike around
                Ithaca's beautiful gorges, and doodle aimlessly. I'm also a big
                fan of fantasy novels and am now on my tenth <em>Lord of the Rings</em> read-through.
                Probably more than tenth, actually...
